# GraphDotNet
A general purpose algorithms and data structures library written entirely in C#. This is currently just a project for my personal development so expect APIs to change, things to be broken and test coverage to not be total. In time I plan on polishing things up until it's ready for some production use. Various implementations will be provided for different use cases and benchmarks will be added to demonstrate the performance under various conditions
